In this activity, you have to write a getEmails.sh bash file, which satisfies the following conditions:

It should accept a single argument representing a txt file. Otherwise it should show "Usage: ./getEmails.sh <valid_file.txt>". If something like "./getEmails.sh <arg1> <arg2>" is used, then it should show the mentioned error message.

Check if the argument file exists or not. If not, show error message "Usage: ./getEmails.sh <valid_file.txt>".

When executed, It should make 3 files: "emails.txt", "sortedEmails.txt", "cseEmails.txt". 

The bash script should extract all the emails of format "<alpha_num>@<alpha>.iitb.ac.in" and store in "emails.txt". Here <alpha_num> can have of alphabets and digits and <alpha>, only alphabets. Assume input.txt file has one email address per line at max, and only email addresses will be present in those lines.

Next, it should sort all the emails based on descending order with case-insensitivity and store the results in "sortedEmails.txt". The sorting is based on lexicographical order.

Next, it should extract all the cse dept emails from sorted emails and store the results in "cseEmails.txt". The cse dept emails are of format "<alpha_num>@cse.iitb.ac.in".
