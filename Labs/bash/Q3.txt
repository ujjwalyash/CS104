Write a Bash Script to rename all pdf files in the current directory in the form of {rollno}.pdf to {rollno}_{name}.pdf. The mapping between roll numbers and names is provided in a file, the address of which is provided as a command line argument. Assume all names are a single word.

Mapping File Format:- 
<rollno> <name>

Example :- 
200050049 Harsh
200050100 Parth
200050129 Sarthak
... (continued)

Usage :- bash submission.sh <path_to_mapping_file>

Example :- If we use the above mapping file, the file 200050100.pdf should be renamed to 200050100_Parth.pdf.

If the mapping does not exist or it is not a valid roll number, that file should remain untouched.

Hint:
For reading from a file, you can use the following:

while read -r line; do
  arr=($line)
done < a.txt
This piece of code reads from the file a.txt line by line. The line is broken up into tokens using spaces as a separator and stored as an array in arr. Now, the words can be indexed as in a normal array.
