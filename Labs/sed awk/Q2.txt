You are given a python script, which, during its execution, generates a message. The message is generated by appending to a variable named message. After running the script, you realize that there is a space at the end of some sentences you append and no space at the end of others. You want to have a space at the end of every sentence you append to the message (note a sentence must end in a full stop(.)). Write a sed script in add_space.sed to do this.

For Example:
message += "Hello." should become message+="Hello. "
message+= "Hello." should become message+="Hello."

where as the following should remain same

str+="Hi"
message=""
message+="this is"
message+="correct. "

We will run your script as sed -E -f add_space.sed <filename>.py > <outfilename>.py
