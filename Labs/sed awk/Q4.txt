You are given a log file (log.txt) that records events in a system where items are produced and consumed. The file consists of statements in the following format:

Produced x by master y
Consumed x by worker y
Master y exiting
Worker y exiting
Each item produced is added to a buffer, and each consumed item is removed from it. Your task is to verify the correctness of this sequence using an AWK script (check.awk).



Given Variables
The following parameters define system constraints:

TOTAL: Total number of items to produce (0 to TOTAL-1).
BUF_SIZE: Maximum size of the buffer.
NUM_MAS: Number of master threads (0 to NUM_MAS-1).
NUM_WOR: Number of worker threads (0 to NUM_WOR-1).


Correctness Conditions
Your script must ensure that:

Each item [0 to TOTAL-1] is produced and consumed exactly once.
Each item is consumed only after it is produced.
The buffer size never exceeds BUF_SIZE at any point.
For each Produced x by master y statement:
y is a valid master thread (y NUM_MAS-1).
y must not have exited before this statement.
For each Consumed x by worker y statement:
y is a valid worker thread (y NUM_WOR-1).
y must not have exited before this statement.
Each master and worker thread exits exactly once and does not produce/consume after exiting.


Expected Output
For each line in log.txt, print the buffer contents (space-separated, in any order) after the statement takes effect.
At the end, print a single word:
"YES" if the log is correct.
"NO" if any of the conditions are violated.
Running Instructions
Command will be run with

awk -v TOTAL=3 -v BUF_SIZE=3 -v NUM_MAS=2 -v NUM_WOR=2 -f check.awk log.txt
Note the values of variables may differ and are found in params.txt


Example
Input (log.txt)
Produced 0 by master 0
Produced 1 by master 0
Consumed 0 by worker 1
Produced 2 by master 1
Consumed 1 by worker 0
Produced 3 by master 1
Consumed 2 by worker 1
Master 0 exiting
Consumed 3 by worker 0
Worker 0 exiting
Worker 1 exiting
Master 1 exiting
Output (check.awk result)
0  
0 1  
1  
1 2  
2  
2 3  
3  
3  




YES  
Here, the log is correct, so the final output is "YES".
